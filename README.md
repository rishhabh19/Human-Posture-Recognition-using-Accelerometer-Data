# Human-Posture-Recognition-using-Accelerometer-Data
Human posture recognition and analysis have been a widely studied topic these days because of wearable devices' innovation. Thus, activity tracking becomes an exciting use-case for healthcare and fitness tracking applications for both the elderly and adults. In this study, we present the analysis of several machine learning models to detect a human's posture by the data gathered by various accelerometers attached to the body. Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent, K-means clustering, and Gaussian Discriminant Analysis are evaluated and reported in this study.
